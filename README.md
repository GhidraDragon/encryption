FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIPE IT URSELF IT TAKES 2 seconds; history only shows something stored in that terminal; i believe VSCode uses a separate just like Iterm if you're a fucking dumbass who uses iterm..

Currently due to erosolar's 50 pages pasted by Sanjay into Megan's mouth I meant publically available records probably forever? whom the fuck would wipe that ?? ,

1. that she's passed screenshots of my Twitter to her, from profile pictures of white kids who look like they're wtf??

2. that i snapped pictures of her inside and outside of the court room "without her consent"

3. that i tweeted the aforementioned white kids "without her consent"

you know that my login may be bo@shang.software and boshang1988@icloud.com 

erosolar redacted sstewart.is1@gmail.com however she's also got erosolar@alum.mit.edu and guess what her Twitch lol email may be?
