FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIPE IT URSELF IT TAKES 2 seconds; history only shows something stored in that terminal; i believe VSCode uses a separate just like Iterm if you're a fucking dumbass who uses iterm.. 

I DO KNOW how normally the whole IO sysstem for secret keys GO; it's just go fuck urself Quartz etc. fuck off, until I've got some more time
